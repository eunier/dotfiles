dovecot >= 2.4 requires manual intervention (Fri, 31 Oct 2025 21:20:51 +0000)
    The dovecot 2.4 release branch has made breaking changes which result
    in it being incompatible with any <= 2.3 configuration file.
    Thus, the dovecot service will no longer be able to start until the
    configuration file was migrated, requiring manual intervention.
    For guidance on the 2.3-to-2.4 migration, please refer to the
    following upstream documentation:
    [0;1m[036mUpgrading Dovecot CE from 2.3 to 2.4[0;0m: https://doc.dovecot.org/latest/installation/upgrade/2.3-to-2.4.html 
    Furthermore, the dovecot 2.4 branch no longer supports their
    replication feature, it was removed.
    For users relying on the replication feature or who are unable to
    perform the 2.4 migration right now, we provide alternative packages
    available in [extra]:
    
    - dovecot23
    - pigeonhole23
    - dovecot23-fts-elastic
    - dovecot23-fts-xapian
    
    The dovecot 2.3 release branch is going to [0;1m[036mreceive critical security
    fixes[0;0m: https://dovecot.org/mailman3/archives/list/dovecot@dovecot.org/thread/3P45L76DOC3NKUNSSPIXQNKINGOCYH5K/
