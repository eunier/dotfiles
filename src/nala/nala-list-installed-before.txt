     Anacron (like "anac(h)ronistic") is a periodic command scheduler.  It
     executes commands at intervals specified in days.  Unlike cron, it
     does not assume that the system is running continuously.  It can
     therefore be used to control the execution of daily, weekly, monthly,
     and yearly jobs (or anything with a period of n days), on systems that
     don't run 24 hours a day.  When installed and configured properly,
     Anacron will make sure that the commands are run at the specified
     intervals as closely as machine uptime permits.
     .
     This package is pre-configured to execute the daily jobs of the
     Debian system.  You should install this program if your system isn't
     powered on 24 hours a day to make sure the maintenance jobs of other

     APG (Automated Password Generator) is the tool set for random
     password generation. It generates some random words of required type
     and prints them to standard output. This binary package contains only
     the standalone version of apg.
     Advantages:
      * Built-in ANSI X9.17 RNG (Random Number Generator)(CAST/SHA1)
      * Built-in password quality checking system (now it has support for Bloom
        filter for faster access)
      * Two Password Generation Algorithms:
         1. Pronounceable Password Generation Algorithm (according to NIST
            FIPS 181)
         2. Random Character Password Generation Algorithm with 35
            configurable modes of operation
      * Configurable password length parameters
      * Configurable amount of generated passwords
      * Ability to initialize RNG with user string
      * Support for /dev/random
      * Ability to crypt() generated passwords and print them as additional output.
      * Special parameters to use APG in script
      * Ability to log password generation requests for network version
      * Ability to control APG service access using tcpd
      * Ability to use password generation service from any type of box (Mac,
        WinXX, etc.) that connected to network
      * Ability to enforce remote users to use only allowed type of password
        generation
     The client/server version of apg has been deliberately omitted.
     .
     Please note that there are security flaws in pronounceable
     password generation schemes (see Ganesan / Davis "A New Attack on
     Random Pronounceable Password Generators", in "Proceedings of the 17th
     National Computer Security Conference (NCSC), Oct. 11-14, 1994
     (Volume 1)", http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/history/nissc/
     1994-17th-NCSC-proceedings-vol-1.pdf, pages 203-216)
     .
     Also note that the FIPS 181 standard from 1993 has been withdrawn by NIST in
     2015 with no superseding publication. This means that the document is
     considered by its publicher as obsolete and not been updated to reference
     current or revised voluntary industry standards, federal specifications, or
     federal data standards.
     .
     apg has not seen upstream attention since 2003, upstream is not answering
     e-mail, and the upstream web page (http://www.adel.nursat.kz/apg/) has been
     gone for years.  The Debian maintainer plans to discontinue apg maintenance as
     soon as an actually maintained software with a comparable feature set becomes
     available.

     .
     Lenses are the building blocks of the file <-> tree transformation; they
     combine parsing a file and building the tree (the get transformation), with
     turning the tree back into an (updated) file (the put transformation).
     .
     The transformation works very hard to preserve comments and formatting

     terms of complexity.
     .
     D-Bus supports broadcast messages, asynchronous messages (thus
     decreasing latency), authentication, and more. It is designed to be
     low-overhead; messages are sent using a binary protocol, not using
     XML. D-Bus also supports a method call mapping for its messages, but
     it is not required; this makes using the system quite simple.
     .
     It comes with several bindings, including GLib, Python, Qt and Java.
     .
     This package provides a fully-functional D-Bus system bus with activation
     support, used for communication between system services, and depends on

     D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.
     Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and CORBA in
     terms of complexity.
     .
     On systemd systems, this package opts in to the session model in which
     a user's session starts the first time they log in, and does not end
     until all their login sessions have ended. This model merges all
     parallel non-graphical login sessions (text mode, ssh, cron, etc.), and up
     to one graphical session, into a single "user-session" or "super-session"
     within which all background D-Bus services are shared.
     .
     Multiple graphical sessions per user are not currently supported in this
     mode; as a result, it is particularly suitable for gdm, which responds to
     requests to open a parallel graphical session by switching to the existing
     graphical session and unlocking it.
     .
     To retain dbus' traditional session semantics, in which login sessions
     are artificially isolated from each other, remove this package and install
     dbus-x11 instead.

├── is installed
└── SMBIOS/DMI table decoder
     Dmidecode reports information about the system's hardware as described in the
     system BIOS according to the SMBIOS/DMI standard.
     .
     This information typically includes system manufacturer, model name, serial
     number, BIOS version, asset tag as well as a lot of other details of varying
     level of interest and reliability depending on the manufacturer. This will
     often include usage status for the CPU sockets, expansion slots (e.g. AGP, PCI,
     ISA) and memory module slots, and the list of I/O ports (e.g. serial, parallel,
     USB).
     .
     Beware that DMI data have proven to be too unreliable to be blindly trusted.
     Dmidecode does not scan the hardware, it only reports what the BIOS told it to.

└── configuration for the Exim MTA (v4)
     Exim (v4) is a mail transport agent. exim4-config provides the configuration
     for the exim4 daemon packages. The configuration framework has been split
     off the main package to allow sites to replace the configuration scheme
     with their own without having to change the actual exim4 packages.
     .
     Sites with special configuration needs (having a lot of identically
     configured machines for example) can use this to distribute their own
     custom configuration via the packaging system, using the magic
     available with dpkg's conffile handling, without having to do local
     changes on all of these machines.
     .
     The Debian exim4 packages have their own web page,

     .
     The name "Noto" is short for "No Tofu",
     describing the aim of covering all living Unicode scripts.
     .
     Tofu (豆腐) is Japanese jargon
     for unicode replacement character "�" (U+FFFD)
     often displayed as replacement for unassigned or unknown characters.

└── extended Unicode Latin font ("a typeface for the nations")
     Gentium ("belonging to the nations" in Latin) is a Unicode typeface family
     designed to enable the many diverse ethnic groups around the world who use
     the Latin script to produce readable, high-quality publications. The design
     is intended to be highly readable, reasonably compact, and visually
     attractive. Gentium has won a "Certificate of Excellence in Typeface Design"
     in two major international typeface design competitions: bukva:raz! (2001)
     and TDC2003 (2003).
     .
     Gentium provides glyphs for a wide range of Latin and Greek characters. The
     additional 'extended' Latin letters are designed to naturally harmonize with
     the traditional 26 ones. Diacritics are treated with careful thought and
     attention to their use. Gentium also supports both ancient and modern Greek,
     including a number of alternate forms. It currently supports the following
     ranges of Unicode 3.0 (completely unless noted):
     .
      Range          Description
     .
      U+0020-U+007F  Basic Latin
      U+00A0-U+00FF  Latin-1 Supplement
      U+0100-U+017F  Latin Extended-A
      U+0180-U+021F  Latin Extended-B
      U+0222-U+0233  Latin Extended-B (continued)
      U+0250-U+02AD  IPA Extensions
      U+02B0-U+02FF  Spacing Modifier Letters
      U+0300-U+036F  Combining Diacritical Marks
      U+0370-U+03D5  Greek (not including archaic or Coptic)
      U+1E00-U+1EFF  Latin Extended Additional
      U+1F00-U+1FFF  Greek Extended
      U+2000-U+203A  General Punctuation (partial)
      U+2070-U+209F  Superscripts and Subscripts
      U+20A0-U+20CF  Currency Symbols (partial)
      U+2100-U+214F  Letterlike Symbols (only a couple)
     .
     Gentium Regular also includes some Cyrillic glyphs, but they are only early
     drafts. A future version will include a completely revised set, including
     italic, and will expand the support for Latin, Greek and Cyrillic to Unicode
     4.1.
     .
     GentiumAlt is an alternate font with flatter diacritics, specifically
     designed for languages using multiple accents.
     .
     The extended sources (Fontlab .vfb) for this font family are available
     in the source package and on the project website.

├── is installed
└── smart Unicode font families (Basic and Book Basic) based on Gentium
     Gentium Basic and Gentium Book Basic are font families based on the original
     Gentium design, but with additional weights. The "Book" family is slightly
     heavier. Both families come with a complete regular, bold, italic and bold
     italic set of fonts.
     .
     The supported character set, however, is much smaller than for the main
     Gentium fonts. These "Basic" fonts support only the Basic Latin and Latin-1
     Supplement Unicode ranges, plus a selection of the more commonly used extended
     Latin characters, with miscellaneous diacritical marks, symbols and
     punctuation. A much more complete character set will be supported in a future
     version of the complete Gentium fonts. These "Basic" fonts are intended as a
     way to provide additional weights for basic font users without waiting until
     the complete Gentium character set is finished.
     .
     There are, however, some wonderful new features that are still missing from
     the main Gentium family:
      * Bold
      * Bold Italic
      * The slightly-heavier Book family
      * OpenType and Graphite smart code for diacritic placement
      * A few useful OpenType and Graphite features
      * Support for a few more recent additions to Unicode
      * Character assignments updated to Unicode 5.1
     .

     search for a fixed string that eliminates impossible text from being
     considered by the full regexp matcher without necessarily having to

     effect of the head. The time delay to the far ear should also be

     Many projects need to work with sizes in bytes (be it sizes of storage
     space, memory, ...) and all of them need to deal with the same issues
     like:
     .
      * How to get a human-readable string for the given size?
      * How to store the given size so that no significant information is lost?
      * How to handle sizes bigger than MAXUINT64?
      * How to interpret sizes entered by users according to their locale and
        typing conventions?
      * How to deal with the decimal/binary units (MB vs. MiB) ambiguity?

└── C interface to the Clang library
     Clang project is a C, C++, Objective C and Objective C++ front-end
     based on the LLVM compiler. Its goal is to offer a replacement to the
     GNU Compiler Collection (GCC).
     .
     Clang implements all of the ISO C++ 1998, 11, 14 and 17 standards and also
     provides most of the support of C++20.
     .
     This package contains the Clang library.
     .
     The C Interface to Clang provides a relatively small API that exposes
     facilities for parsing source code into an abstract syntax tree (AST),
     loading already-parsed ASTs, traversing the AST, associating physical source
     locations with elements within the AST, and other facilities that support
     Clang-based development tools.

├── is installed
└── utility to determine the locale encoding
     In many applications it's wise to let Perl use Unicode for the strings it
     processes. Most of the interfaces Perl has to the outside world are still byte
     based. Programs therefore need to decode byte strings that enter the program
     from the outside and encode them again on the way out.
     .
     The POSIX locale system is used to specify both the language conventions
     requested by the user and the preferred character set to consume and output.
     The Encode::Locale module looks up the charset and encoding (called a CODESET
     in the locale jargon) and arranges for the Encode module to know this encoding
     under the name "locale". It means bytes obtained from the environment can be
     converted to Unicode strings by calling Encode::encode(locale => $bytes) and
     converted back again with Encode::decode(locale => $string).

     for errors/exceptions that can either be thrown, for subsequent catch, or can
     simply be recorded.

     Errors in the class "Error" should not be thrown directly, but the user
     should throw errors from a sub-class of "Error".

     Warning: Using the "Error" module is no longer recommended due to the
     black-magical nature of its syntactic sugar, which often tends to break. Its

     portable and high-quality software solutions for digital typography.
     They specifically target embedded systems and focus on providing small,
     efficient and ubiquitous products.
     .
     The FreeType 2 library is their new software font engine.  It has been
     designed to provide the following important features:
      * A universal and simple API to manage font files
      * Support for several font formats through loadable modules
      * High-quality anti-aliasing
      * High portability & performance
     .
     Supported font formats include:
      * TrueType files (.ttf) and collections (.ttc)
      * Type 1 font files both in ASCII (.pfa) or binary (.pfb) format
      * Type 1 Multiple Master fonts.  The FreeType 2 API also provides
        routines to manage design instances easily
      * Type 1 CID-keyed fonts
      * OpenType/CFF (.otf) fonts
      * CFF/Type 2 fonts
      * Adobe CEF fonts (.cef), used to embed fonts in SVG documents with
        the Adobe SVG viewer plugin.
      * Windows FNT/FON bitmap fonts
     .
     This package contains the files needed to run programs that use the
     FreeType 2 library.

     This is C library which support talking with FSP server using FSP v2 protocol
     and provides posix-like file manipulation interface.
     .
     FSP is a protocol, a bit like FTP, for moving files around. It's designed for
     anonymous archives, and has protection against server and network overloading.
     It doesn't use connections, so it can survive things falling over. It's also
     designed to prevent network congestion, so it can be very nice for large
     transfers over slow links.
     .

└── Frame Streams (fstrm) library
     Frame Streams is a light weight, binary clean protocol that allows for the
     transport of arbitrarily encoded data payload sequences with minimal framing
     overhead -- just four bytes per data frame. Frame Streams does not specify an
     encoding format for data frames and can be used with any data serialization
     format that produces byte sequences, such as Protocol Buffers, XML, JSON,
     MessagePack, YAML, etc. Frame Streams can be used as both a streaming
     transport over a reliable byte stream socket (TCP sockets, TLS connections,
     AF_UNIX sockets, etc.) for data in motion as well as a file format for data
     at rest. A "Content Type" header identifies the type of payload being carried
     over an individual Frame Stream and allows cooperating programs to determine
     how to interpret a given sequence of data payloads.
     .
     This is the "fstrm" implementation of Frame Streams in C.

     GSM 06.10 compresses frames of 160 13-bit samples (8 kHz sampling
     rate, i.e. a frame rate of 50 Hz) into 260 bits; for compatibility
     with typical UNIX applications, this implementation turns frames of
     160 16-bit linear samples into 33-byte frames (1650 Bytes/s).
     The quality of the algorithm is good enough for reliable speaker
     recognition; even music often survives transcoding in recognizable
     form (given the bandwidth limitations of 8 kHz sampling rate).
     .
     The interfaces offered are a front end modelled after compress(1), and
     a library API.  Compression and decompression run faster than realtime
     on most SPARCstations.  The implementation has been verified against the

     about.
     .
     Cookies are a general mechanism which server side connections can use to both
     store and retrieve information on the client side of the connection. For more
     information about cookies refer to
     <URL:http://curl.haxx.se/rfc/cookie_spec.html> and
     <URL:http://www.cookiecentral.com/>. HTTP::Cookies also implements the new
     style cookies described in RFC 2965. The two variants of cookies are supposed
     to be able to coexist happily.
     .
     Instances of the class HTTP::Cookies are able to store a collection of
     Set-Cookie2: and Set-Cookie: headers and are able to use this information to
     initialize Cookie-headers in HTTP::Request objects. The state of a
     HTTP::Cookies object can be saved in and restored from files.

libhttp-daemon-perl 6.16-1 [Debian/trixie main]
├── is installed
└── simple http server class
     Instances of the HTTP::Daemon class are HTTP/1.1 servers that listen on a

     IO::Socket::IP, so you can perform socket operations directly on it too.
     .
     The accept() method will return when a connection from a client is available.
     The returned value will be an HTTP::Daemon::ClientConn object which is
     another IO::Socket::IP subclass. Calling the get_request() method on this
     object will read data from the client and return an HTTP::Request object. The
     ClientConn object also provide methods to send back various responses.
     .
     This HTTP daemon does not fork(2) for you. Your application, i.e. the user of
     the HTTP::Daemon is responsible for forking if that is desirable. Also note
     that the user is responsible for generating responses that conform to the

└── converts plain array images into multi-size representation
     The LiquidRescale (lqr) library provides a C/C++ API for performing
     non-uniform resizing of images by the seam-carving technique.
     .
     The library takes images in plain array format as input and converts
     them to a multi-size representation.
     .
     Following is a list of features:
     .
       * Areas in the image can be marked for preservation or discard
       * Once the image has been fully processed, the scaling can be done
         in real-time. In fact, the information can be saved and read out
         later without any further processing
       * The resizing is done with a single function which automatically
         performs all the necessary operations; it can also work in
         successive steps without wasting computational time
       * Possibility to tune the carving operation by letting the seams be
         less connected, or more rigid, or both
       * Can export and import the visibility map (the seams)
       * Other images can be attached and undergo the same carving process
         as the parent image
       * The automatic feature detection algorithm can be tuned by
         selecting among different energy gradient functions
       * Reports progress through a customizable interface
       * A signalling system permits one to cleanly handle errors
     .
     The library implements the algorithm described in the paper "Seam
     Carving for Content-Aware Image Resizing" by Shai Avidan and Ariel
     Shamir, which can be found at
     http://www.faculty.idc.ac.il/arik/imret.pdf

     This library aims to provide simple helpers that allows you to re-use code
     and to avoid re-inventing the wheel.
     .
     The main features of this library are:
     .
     Small: the shared library requires around 30KB for an x86-based computer.
     .
     Simple: this library avoids complexity and elaborated abstractions that
     tend to hide Netlink details.
     .
     Easy to use: the library simplifies the work for Netlink-wise developers.
     It provides functions to make socket handling, message building,
     validating, parsing and sequence tracking, easier.
     .
     Easy to re-use: you can use the library to build your own abstraction
     layer on top of this library.
     .
     Decoupling: the interdependency of the main bricks that compose the
     library is reduced, i.e. the library provides many helpers, but the
     programmer is not forced to use them.

     Raptor is a C library providing a set of parsers and serializers for
     Resource Description Framework (RDF) triples by parsing syntaxes or
     serializing the triples into a syntax.
     .
     The parsing syntaxes are RDF/JSON, RDF/XML, N-Triples, Turtle, GRDDL and RSS
     tag soup including Atom 0.3 and Atom 1.0.  The serializing syntaxes
     are RDF/XML, N-Quads, N-Triples RSS 1.0 and Atom 1.0.  Raptor can handle
     RDF/XML as used by RDF applications such as RSS 1.0, FOAF, DOAP,
     Dublin Core and OWL.

     interface is based on sockets, but adapted for queue pair (QP) based
     semantics: communication must use a specific RDMA device, and data
     transfers are message-based.

└── efficient, principled regular expression library
     RE2 is a fast, safe, thread-friendly alternative to backtracking regular
     expression engines like those used in PCRE, Perl, and Python. It is a C++
     library.
     .
     RE2 uses automata theory to guarantee that regular expression searches run in
     time linear in the size of the input. RE2 implements memory limits, so that
     searches can be constrained to a fixed amount of memory. RE2 is engineered to
     use a small fixed C++ stack footprint no matter what inputs or regular
     expressions it must process; thus RE2 is useful in multithreaded environments
     where thread stacks cannot grow arbitrarily large.
     .
     On large inputs, RE2 is often much faster than backtracking engines; its use
     of automata theory lets it apply optimizations that the others cannot.

└── lightweight RDF syntax library
     Serd is a lightweight C library for RDF syntax which supports reading

     .
     Serd is not intended to be a swiss-army knife of RDF syntax, but rather
     is suited to resource limited applications, or situations where a simple
     reader/writer with minimal dependencies is ideal (e.g. in LV2 hosts or
     plugins).
     .
     Serd is:
      * small: Serd is implemented in under 2500 lines1 of standard C code.
      * portable and dependency-free: Serd uses only the C standard library,
        and has no external dependencies, making it a lightweight dependency
        in every sense.
      * fast and lightweight: Serd (and the included serdi tool) can be used
        to stream abbreviated Turtle (unlike many other tools which can not
        stream since they must first build an internal model to abbreviate).
        In other words, Serd can re-serialise an unbounded amount of Turtle
        using a fixed amount of memory, preserving the abbreviations in the
        input.
      * conformant and well-tested: Serd is written to the Turtle, NTriples
        and URI specifications, and includes a comprehensive test suite which
        includes all the normative examples from the Turtle specification, all
        the "normal" examples from the URI specification, and additional tests
        added specifically for Serd. The test suite has over 96% code coverage
        (by line), and runs with zero memory errors or leaks.

     FFmpeg is the leading multimedia framework, able to decode, encode, transcode,

     cutting edge.
     .
     This library performs highly optimized audio resampling, rematrixing
     and sample format conversion operations.
     Specifically, this library performs the following conversions:
      * Resampling is the process of changing the audio rate, for example from a
        high sample rate of 44100Hz to 8000Hz. Audio conversion from high to low
        sample rate is a lossy process. Several resampling options and algorithms
        are available.
      * Rematrixing is the process of changing the channel layout, for example from
        stereo to mono. When the input channels cannot be mapped to the output
        streams, the process is lossy, since it involves different gain factors
        and mixing. Various other audio conversions (e.g. stretching and padding)
        are enabled through dedicated options.
      * Format conversion is the process of converting the type of samples, for
        example from 16-bit signed samples to unsigned 8-bit or float samples.
        It also handles packing conversion, when passing from packed layout (all
        samples belonging to distinct channels interleaved in the same buffer), to
        planar layout (all samples belonging to the same channel stored in a
        dedicated buffer or "plane").

└── Encoder of AVS2-P2/IEEE1857.4 video coding standard - runtime files
     AVS2 is a new generation of video coding standard developed by the IEEE 1857
     Working Group under project 1857.4
     .
     AVS2 is designed to achieve significant coding efficiency improvements
     relative to the preceding H.264/MPEG4-AVC and AVS1 standards. The basic
     coding framework of AVS2 is similar to the conterminous HEVC/H.265, but
     AVS2 can provide more efficient compression for certain video applications
     such as surveillance as well as low-delay communication such as
     videoconferencing.

     libXaw7 provides the second version of Xaw, the Athena Widgets toolkit,
     which is largely used by legacy X applications.  This version is the
     most common version, as version 6 is considered deprecated, and version
     8, which adds Xprint support, is unsupported and not widely used.
     In general, use of a more modern toolkit such as GTK+ is recommended.

└── X cursor management library
     Xcursor is a simple library designed to help locate and load cursors for the
     X Window System.  Cursors can be loaded from files or memory and can exist in
     several sizes; the library automatically picks the best size.  When using
     images loaded from files, Xcursor prefers to use the Render extension's
     CreateCursor request for rendering cursors.  Where the Render extension is
     not supported, Xcursor maps the cursor image to a standard X cursor and uses
     the core X protocol CreateCursor request.
     .
     Preferred themes for cursors can be installed if desired, via
     xcursor-themes or other cursor-theme or icon-theme packages,
     configured with update-alternatives --config x-cursor-theme.

└── C++ interface to the GNOME XML library (libxml2)
     Libxml++ is a C++ wrapper for the libxml2 XML parser library (otherwise
     known as the GNOME XML library).  It has SAX and DOM-like APIs, but does not
     attempt to conform exactly to the DOM specification because they are not
     aimed at C++.  Its API is much simpler than the underlying libxml C API.

libxml-parser-perl 2.47-1+b3 [Debian/trixie main]
├── is installed
└── Perl module for parsing XML files
     The XML::Parser module provides ways to parse XML documents.  It is built on
     top of XML::Parser::Expat, which is a lower level interface to James Clark's
     expat library. Each call to one of the parsing methods creates a new instance
     of XML::Parser::Expat which is then used to parse the document. Expat options
     may be provided when the XML::Parser object is created. These options are
     then passed on to the Expat object on each parse call. They can also be given
     as extra arguments to the parse methods, in which case they override options
     given at XML::Parser creation time.
     .
     The behavior of the parser is controlled either by Style and/or Handlers
     options, or by setHandlers method. These all provide mechanisms for
     XML::Parser to set the handlers needed by XML::Parser::Expat. If neither
     Style nor Handlers are specified, then parsing just checks the document for
     being well-formed.
     .
     When underlying handlers get called, they receive as their first parameter
     the Expat object, not the Parser object.

libxml-twig-perl 1:3.52-3 [Debian/trixie main]
├── is installed
└── Perl module for processing huge XML documents in tree mode
     The XML::Twig module provides a way to process XML documents.  It is built on
     top of XML::Parser.
     .
     The module offers a tree interface to the document, while allowing to
     output the parts of it that have been completely processed.
     .
     It allows minimal resource (CPU and memory) usage by building the
     tree only for the parts of the documents that need actual processing,
     through the use of the twig_roots and twig_print_outside_roots
     options.  The finish and finish_print methods also help to increase
     performance.
     .
     XML::Twig tries to make simple things easy so it tries its best to
     takes care of a lot of the (usually) annoying (but sometimes
     necessary) features that come with XML and XML::Parser.

libxml-xpathengine-perl 0.14-2 [Debian/trixie main]
├── is installed
└── re-usable XPath engine for DOM-like trees
     XML::XPathEngine provides an XPath engine, that can be re-used by other
     module/classes that implement trees.
     .
     In order to use the XPath engine, nodes in the user module need to mimic
     DOM nodes. The degree of similarity between the user tree and a DOM dictates
     how much of the XPath features can be used. A module implementing all of the
     DOM should be able to use this module very easily (you might need to add
     the cmp method on nodes in order to get ordered result sets).
     .
     This module is derived from Matt Sergeant's XML::XPath.

low-memory-monitor 2.1-2+b1 [Debian/trixie main]
├── is installed
└── Monitors low-memory conditions
     The Low Memory Monitor is an early boot daemon that will monitor memory

     to user-space applications when memory is running low, and then optionally
     activate the kernel's OOM killer when memory is running really low.

lp-solve 5.5.2.11-2 [Debian/trixie main]
├── is installed
└── Solve (mixed integer) linear programming problems
     The linear programming (LP) problem can be formulated as: Solve A.x >=
     V1, with V2.x maximal. A is a matrix, x is a vector of (nonnegative)
     variables, V1 is a vector called the right hand side, and V2 is a vector
     specifying the objective function.
     .
     An integer linear programming (ILP) problem is an LP with the
     constraint that all the variables are integers.  In a mixed integer
     linear programming (MILP) problem, some of the variables are integer
     and others are real.
     .
     The program lp_solve solves LP, ILP, and MILP problems. It is slightly
     more general than suggested above, in that every row of A (specifying
     one constraint) can have its own (in)equality, <=, >= or =. The result
     specifies values for all variables.
     .
     lp_solve uses the 'Simplex' algorithm and sparse matrix methods for
     pure LP problems.  If one or more of the variables is declared
     integer, the Simplex algorithm is iterated with a branch and bound
     algorithm, until the desired optimal solution is found.  lp_solve can
     read MPS format input files.

     pass phrases.  That means it tries to take care that the entered
     information is not swapped to disk or temporarily stored anywhere.
     This functionality is particularly useful for entering pass phrases
     when using encryption software such as GnuPG or e-mail clients using
     the same.  It uses an open protocol and is therefore not tied to
     particular software.
     .
     The program contained in this package implements a PIN entry dialog
     using the GTK+ tool kit version 2.  If the X Window System is not
     active then an alternative text-mode dialog will be used.  There are
     sibling packages that implement PIN entry dialogs using other tool
     kits.

     It was previously named PolicyKit.
     .
     pkexec is a setuid program to allow certain users to run commands as
     root or as a different user, similar to sudo. Unlike sudo, it carries
     out authentication and authorization by sending a request to polkit,
     so it uses desktop environments' familiar prompting mechanisms for
     authentication and uses polkit policies for authorization decisions.
     .
     By default, members of the 'sudo' Unix group can use pkexec to run any
     command after authenticating. The authorization rules can be changed by
     the local system administrator.
     .
     If this functionality is not required, removing the pkexec package will
     reduce security risk by removing a setuid program.

     polkit is an application-level toolkit for defining and handling the policy

     .
     It is a framework for centralizing the decision making process with respect to
     granting access to privileged operations for unprivileged (desktop)
     applications.
     .
     In a typical use of polkit, an unprivileged application such as gnome-disks
     sends requests via D-Bus or other inter-process communication mechanisms
     to a privileged system service such as udisks, which asks polkitd for
     permission to process those requests. This allows the application to carry
     out privileged tasks without making use of setuid, which avoids several
     common sources of security vulnerabilities.
     .
     This package provides the polkitd D-Bus service and supporting programs.
     The pkexec program is not included, and can be found in the pkexec package.

      * to effortlessly add rich output to your application, you can import the rich
        print method, which has the same signature as the builtin Python function
      * Rich can be installed in the Python REPL, so that any data structures will
        be pretty printed and highlighted
      * for more control over rich terminal content, import and construct a Console
        object. The Console object has a print method which has an intentionally
        similar interface to the builtin print function
      * to insert an emoji in to console output place the name between two colons
      * Rich can render flexible tables with unicode box characters. There is a
        large variety of formatting options for borders, styles, cell alignment etc
      * Rich can render multiple flicker-free progress bars to track long-running
        tasks.
      * Rich can render content in neat columns with equal or optimal width.
      * Rich can render markdown and does a reasonable job of translating the
        formatting to the terminal
      * Rich can render beautiful tracebacks which are easier to read and show more
        code than standard Python tracebacks. You can set Rich as the default
        traceback handler so all uncaught exceptions will be rendered by Rich.

     Speech Dispatcher provides a device independent layer for speech synthesis.
     It supports various software and hardware speech synthesizers as
     backends and provides a generic layer for synthesizing speech and
     playing back PCM data via those different backends to applications.
     .
     Various high level concepts like enqueueing vs. interrupting speech and
     application specific user configurations are implemented in a device
     independent way, therefore freeing the application programmer from
     having to yet again reinvent the wheel.
     .
     This package contains a Python library for communication with Speech
     Dispatcher.

     example, US-ASCII and iso-8859-1 on the web are actually aliases for
     windows-1252, and an UTF-8 or UTF-16 BOM takes precedence over any other
     encoding declaration.  The Encoding standard defines all such details so that

     The rngd daemon acts as a bridge between a Hardware TRNG (true random number

     PRNG (pseudo-random number generator).
     .
     It tests the data received from the TRNG using the FIPS 140-2 (2002-10-10)
     tests to verify that it is indeed random, and feeds the random data to the
     kernel entropy pool.
     .
     This increases the bandwidth of the /dev/random device, from a source that
     does not depend on outside activity. This may improve the behavior of systems
     which experience low values in /proc/sys/kernel/random/entropy_avail
     It may also improve the quality (entropy) of the randomness of /dev/random.
     .
     A TRNG kernel module such as hw_random, or some other source of true
     entropy that is accessible as a device or fifo, is required to use this

ucf 3.0049 [Debian/trixie main]
├── is installed
└── Update Configuration File(s): preserve user changes to config files
     Debian policy mandates that user changes to configuration files must be
     preserved during package upgrades. The easy way to achieve this behavior
     is to make the configuration file a 'conffile', in which case dpkg
     handles the file specially during upgrades, prompting the user as
     needed.
     .
     This is appropriate only if it is possible to distribute a default
     version that will work for most installations, although some system
     administrators may choose to modify it. This implies that the
     default version will be part of the package distribution, and must
     not be modified by the maintainer scripts during installation (or at
     any other time).
     .
     This script attempts to provide conffile-like handling for files that
     may not be labelled conffiles, and are not shipped in a Debian package,
     but handled by the postinst instead. This script allows one to
     maintain files in /etc, preserving user changes and in general
     offering the same facilities while upgrading that dpkg normally
     provides for 'conffiles'.
     .
     Additionally, this script provides facilities for transitioning a
     file that had not been provided with conffile-like protection to come
     under this schema, and attempts to minimize questions asked at
     installation time. Indeed, the transitioning facility is better than the
     one offered by dpkg while transitioning a file from a non-conffile to
     conffile status.

├── is installed
└── retrieves files from the web
     Wget is a network utility to retrieve files from the web
     using HTTP(S) and FTP, the two most widely used internet
     protocols. It works non-interactively, so it will work in
     the background, after having logged off. The program supports
     recursive retrieval of web-authoring pages as well as FTP
     sites -- you can use Wget to make mirrors of archives and
     home pages or to travel the web like a WWW robot.
     .
     Wget works particularly well with slow or unstable connections
     by continuing to retrieve a document until the document is fully
     downloaded. Re-getting files from where it left off works on
     servers (both HTTP and FTP) that support it. Both HTTP and FTP
     retrievals can be time stamped, so Wget can see if the remote
     file has changed since the last retrieval and automatically
     retrieve the new version if it has.
     .
     Wget supports proxy servers; this can lighten the network load,
     speed up retrieval, and provide access behind firewalls.

     For this proxy to be useful, restricted D-Bus clients must be denied
     access to the normal D-Bus socket (for example by using containers or

     xdg-desktop-portal provides a portal frontend service for Flatpak, Snap,

     is made available to the sandboxed application, and provides mediated
     D-Bus interfaces for file access, URI opening, printing and similar
     desktop integration features.
     .
     The implementation of these interfaces is expected to require
     user confirmation before responding to the sandboxed application's
     requests. For example, when the sandboxed application ask to open a file,
     the portal implementation will open an "Open" dialog outside the sandbox,
     and will only make the selected file available to the sandboxed app if
     that dialog is confirmed.
     .
     xdg-desktop-portal is designed to be desktop-agnostic, and uses a
     desktop-environment-specific GUI backend such as xdg-desktop-portal-gtk
     to provide its functionality.

     .
     It maps file objects from POSIX compliant file systems into Rock Ridge
     enhanced ISO-9660 file systems and features session-wise manipulation
     of such file systems. It can load the management information of existing
     ISO images and write the resulting session to optical medium or as
     file system objects.

      - DVD-R, DVD-R DL, DVD-RW, DVD+R, DVD+R DL, DVD+RW, DVD-RAM
      - BD-R, BD-RE
     .
     Some interesting features:
      - Emulation of the mkisofs and cdrecord programs.
      - Data backup and restore capabilities - compression, ACLs, and filters.
      - Isohybrid MBR with partition offset - features booting ISOLINUX from
        USB sticks, or from other devices that appear to PC-BIOS as hard disks.
        The images carry a conventional partition table for a USB stick;
        the first partition reports the size of the ISO image, but starts at a
        non-zero address. It is nevertheless still mountable.
      - Jigdo Template Export - jigdo representation of the resulting ISO-9660
