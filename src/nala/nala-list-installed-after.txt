     and prints them to standard output. This binary package contains only
     the standalone version of apg.
     Advantages:
      * Built-in ANSI X9.17 RNG (Random Number Generator)(CAST/SHA1)
      * Built-in password quality checking system (now it has support for Bloom
        filter for faster access)
      * Two Password Generation Algorithms:
         1. Pronounceable Password Generation Algorithm (according to NIST
            FIPS 181)
         2. Random Character Password Generation Algorithm with 35
            configurable modes of operation
      * Configurable password length parameters
      * Configurable amount of generated passwords
      * Ability to initialize RNG with user string
      * Support for /dev/random
      * Ability to crypt() generated passwords and print them as additional output.
      * Special parameters to use APG in script
      * Ability to log password generation requests for network version
      * Ability to control APG service access using tcpd
      * Ability to use password generation service from any type of box (Mac,
        WinXX, etc.) that connected to network
      * Ability to enforce remote users to use only allowed type of password
        generation
     The client/server version of apg has been deliberately omitted.
     .
     Please note that there are security flaws in pronounceable
     password generation schemes (see Ganesan / Davis "A New Attack on
     Random Pronounceable Password Generators", in "Proceedings of the 17th
     National Computer Security Conference (NCSC), Oct. 11-14, 1994

     1994-17th-NCSC-proceedings-vol-1.pdf, pages 203-216)
     .
     Also note that the FIPS 181 standard from 1993 has been withdrawn by NIST in
     2015 with no superseding publication. This means that the document is
     considered by its publicher as obsolete and not been updated to reference
     current or revised voluntary industry standards, federal specifications, or
     federal data standards.
     .
     apg has not seen upstream attention since 2003, upstream is not answering
     e-mail, and the upstream web page (http://www.adel.nursat.kz/apg/) has been
     gone for years.  The Debian maintainer plans to discontinue apg maintenance as

     devices). It also emits signals if new devices are connected (or
     removed). During enrollment devices can be set to be automatically
     authorized as soon as they are connected.  A command line tool, called
     boltctl, can be used to control the daemon and perform all the above
     mentioned tasks.

      - SMTP protocol  (/usr/sbin/sendmail interface only is used);
      - POP3/IMAP      (bsd-mailx reads local mailboxes only);
      - maildir format (traditional mbox only format is supported).
     .
     If the above features are needed, please consider installing another package
     providing similar /usr/bin/mail interface:

bubblewrap 0.11.0-2 [Debian/trixie main]
├── is installed
└── utility for unprivileged chroot and namespace manipulation
     bubblewrap uses Linux namespaces to launch unprivileged containers.
     These containers can be used to sandbox semi-trusted applications such
     as Flatpak apps, image/video thumbnailers and web browser components,
     or to run programs in a different library stack such as a Flatpak runtime
     or a different Debian release.
     .
     By default, this package relies on a kernel with user namespaces enabled.
     Official Debian and Ubuntu kernels are suitable.
     .
     On kernels without user namespaces, system administrators can make the
     bwrap executable setuid root, allowing it to create unprivileged
     containers even though ordinary user processes cannot.

build-essential 12.12 [Debian/trixie main]
├── is installed
└── Informational list of build-essential packages
     If you do not plan to build Debian packages, you don't need this

     for building Debian packages.
     .
     This package contains an informational list of packages which are
     considered essential for building Debian packages.  This package also
     depends on the packages on that list, to make it easy to have the
     build-essential packages installed.
     .
     If you have this package installed, you only need to install whatever
     a package specifies as its build-time dependencies to build the
     package.  Conversely, if you are determining what your package needs
     to build-depend on, you can always leave out the packages this
     package depends on.
     .
     This package is NOT the definition of what packages are
     build-essential; the real definition is in the Debian Policy Manual.
     This package contains merely an informational list, which is all
     most people need.   However, if this package and the manual disagree,
     the manual is correct.

busybox 1:1.37.0-4 [Debian/trixie main]
├── is installed
└── Tiny utilities for small and embedded systems
     BusyBox combines tiny versions of many common UNIX utilities into a single
     small executable. It provides minimalist replacements for the most common
     utilities you would usually find on your desktop system (i.e., ls, cp, mv,
     mount, tar, etc.). The utilities in BusyBox generally have fewer options than
     their full-featured GNU cousins; however, the options that are included
     provide the expected functionality and behave very much like their GNU
     counterparts.
     .
     This package installs the BusyBox binary but does not install
     symlinks for any of the supported utilities. Some of the utilities
     can be used in the system by installing the busybox-syslogd,
     udhcpc or udhcpd packages.

     considerably better than that achieved by more conventional
     LZ77/LZ78-based compressors, and approaches the performance of the PPM
     family of statistical compressors.

     D-Bus supports broadcast messages, asynchronous messages (thus
     decreasing latency), authentication, and more. It is designed to be
     low-overhead; messages are sent using a binary protocol, not using
     XML. D-Bus also supports a method call mapping for its messages, but
     it is not required; this makes using the system quite simple.
     .
     It comes with several bindings, including GLib, Python, Qt and Java.

     D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.
     Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and CORBA in
     terms of complexity.
     .
     On systemd systems, this package opts in to the session model in which
     a user's session starts the first time they log in, and does not end
     until all their login sessions have ended. This model merges all
     parallel non-graphical login sessions (text mode, ssh, cron, etc.), and up
     to one graphical session, into a single "user-session" or "super-session"
     within which all background D-Bus services are shared.
     .
     Multiple graphical sessions per user are not currently supported in this
     mode; as a result, it is particularly suitable for gdm, which responds to
     requests to open a parallel graphical session by switching to the existing
     graphical session and unlocking it.
     .
     To retain dbus' traditional session semantics, in which login sessions
     are artificially isolated from each other, remove this package and install
     dbus-x11 instead.

flatpak 1.16.0-1 [Debian/trixie main]
├── is installed
└── Application deployment framework for desktop apps
     Flatpak installs, manages and runs sandboxed desktop application bundles.
     Application bundles run partially isolated from the wider system, using
     containerization techniques such as namespaces to prevent direct access
     to system resources. Resources from outside the sandbox can be accessed
     via "portal" services, which are responsible for access control; for
     example, the Documents portal displays an "Open" dialog outside the
     sandbox, then allows the application to access only the selected file.
     .
     Each application uses a specified "runtime", or set of libraries, which is
     available as /usr inside its sandbox. This can be used to run application
     bundles with multiple, potentially incompatible sets of dependencies within
     the same desktop environment.
     .
     This package contains the services and executables needed to install and
     launch sandboxed applications, and the portal services needed to provide
     limited access to resources outside the sandbox.
